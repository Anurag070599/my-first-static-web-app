        <h2 class="heading">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity  exploits  that  take  advantage  of  weak   passwords   continue   to   succeed   in   virtually   every   industry.  This  motivates  interest  in  empirically  determining  the  extent  to  which  websites  that  invite  visitors  to  create  new  user accounts on them encourage or require users to engage in better   password   management   practices,   including   strong   passwords.  This  project  examined  a  statistically  significant  sample of websites to assess how closely they voluntarily adhere to   the   National   Institute   of   Standards   and   Technology’s   authoritative   guidance   on   password   policies.   Over   100   representative  websites  were  selected  from  industries  that  consistently  report  the  most  breaches  in  the  Verizon  Data  Breach  Investigation  Report.  Their  respective  user  account  creation  processes  were  assessed  via  a  scorecard  approach  based  on  observations  collected  when  following standardized experimental     procedures.     Scorecard     data     then     were     aggregated  and  analyzed  for  trends.  The  research  findings  highlight potential vulnerabilities that persist in online account password creation practices, leaving many websites susceptible to    brute    force    attacks    due    to    cyber    hygiene    lapses.    Recommendations  to  help  remediate  compliance  gaps  and  as  paths  forward  to  build  upon  this  work  include  refining  the  proposed  scorecard,  creating  and  using  standardized  user  registration  and  profile  manager  plugins,  widely  adopting  user-friendly   password   management   tools,   and   enacting   tougher  legal  consequences  for  website  hosts  when  breaches  occur.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>As technology and computing power increase, so does the ability of threat actors to compromise passwords. At the same time, whether driven by convenience or necessity, people are doing  more  professional  and  personal  activities  online  than  ever before [1]; and in doing so they share relevant personal information that businesses as well as bad actors can leverage for their own purposes. While news of data breaches should make everyone increasingly wary of how well data they share online  is  being  safeguarded  by  the  companies  that  house  them, users continue to create weak passwords. According to an online study published by YouGov, over half of all online users are using the same passwords for most of their accounts [4].In  short,  left  to  their  own  choices,  users’  passwords  are  not  secure  despite  well-publicized  breach  incidents  and  clearly defined best practices from reputable bodies like the National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST).  When websites invite visitors to create online accounts, but then do not enforce compliance with authoritative password guidance,   this   effectively   results   in   a   virtually   endless   vulnerable  attack  surface  for  cyber  criminals  who  seek  to  breach,  then  exfiltrate  and  exploit  personal  and  financial  information.The goal of this project was to empirically investigate the extent to which website hosts try to foster strong passwords during  online  account  creation.  This  research  is  important  because  it  highlights  potential  vulnerabilities  that  persist  in  online account creation. In addition, it proposes a scorecard approach  for  rating  how  closely  sites  follow  authoritative  guidance regarding strong passwords. Together this builds a foundation for suggesting specific ways both end users and online  hosts  still  may  need  to  close  the  gap  between  being  aware of simple cybersecurity hygiene and actually putting it into practice.The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  II  presents  background  information  regarding  the  prevalence of weak password use and authoritative password guidance.  Section  III  explains  methodologies  used  for  the  experiment. Section IV discusses findings from data analysis. Section  V  suggests  some  recommendations  for  remedying  password compliance gaps. Section VI summarizes the paper and suggests ways to build upon this work.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Background</h2>
        <p>A.Problem ScopeSeveral  studies  have  shown  how  a  random  sample  of  dictionary attacks alone was able to break up to 24 percent of tested  passwords  [4][5][6].  There  are  between  12  and  24  million  ecommerce  sites  across  all  business  segments  [2].  Extrapolating    such    historical    findings    across    every    ecommerce  account  ever  created  implies  virtually  every  internet user is highly likely to have data at risk via credential breaches.A  survey  of  over  1000  individuals  conducted  by  the  security giant Avast concluded that 83 percent of all users are using  weak  passwords  [7].  Troy  Hunt,  a  world-renowned 2023 Journal of The Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education, Volume 10, No. 1, Winter 2023 979-8-3858-4381-7/23/$ 26.00 ©2023   CISSE2 www.cisse.infoexpert on security and data breaches, hosts a website where he  has  collected  over  half  a  billion  passwords  that  have  appeared in known data breaches. Among his most alarming discoveries: in just one breach involving 6.8 million records, 71 percent of those passwords were already in the database of compromised passwords he had compiled [8].According to a recent Verizon Data Breach Investigation Reports  (DBIR),  every  industry  category  they  track  has  experienced an incident in which password cracking via bruteforce attack enabled the breach. In fact, the DBIR has cited stolen or compromised credentials as the top cause of all data breaches for many years [3]. In other words, users continue to create weak, easily cracked passwords.B.Authoritative Password GuidanceIn   2019,   the   National   Institute   of   Standards   and   Technology   released   Special   Publication   (SP)   800-63-3 which  outlines  new  recommendations  for  authenticating  users to combat this significant vulnerability in the account creation  process.  The  SP  builds  on  findings  over  several  years   to   overturn   previously   accepted   best   practices,   replacing them with a new gold standard. As shown in Table I,   it lays out nine main points that should be considered when creating  password  policies  with  an  eye  toward  security  and  robust authentication [11].TABLE I. NIST PASSWORD GUIDANCEAttribute Criteria Length Minimum of 8 when selected by a human; 6 when assigned by a system or service; maximum of 64 should be allowed.Character types All ASCII characters, including spaces, should be allowed.Truncation Shortening of passwords should never be implemented. Screening Checking proposed passwords against dictionaries of commonly used, easy-to-guess  passwords is recommended. Complexity Requiring complexity criteria must be met is not recommended.Lockout Locking the account after a set number (e.g., 10) of failed login attempts is recommended.Expiration Requiring users to change their passwordswith high frequency is not recommended.Knowledge-based authentication Hints and security questions to retrieve or reset forgotten passwords are not recommended. Two-factorauthentication (2FA)Short Message Service (SMS)-based approaches are not recommended; one-time rotating password applications areacceptable. C.Motivation for StudyDespite    an    abundance    of    authoritative    password    guidance, users continue to compose weak passwords and to reuse passwords across multiple online accounts, offering a ubiquitous    attack    surface    for    cyber    criminals.    This    observation motivated interest in empirically determining the extent to which websites that invite users to create accounts encourage  or  require  them  to  create  strong  passwords  or  to  engage   in   better   password   management   practices   in   alignment with NIST guidance.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Methodology</h2>
        <p>This project inspected the account creation process for a statistically significant number of websites that invite visitors to    create    password-protected    accounts.    The    overall    experiment included the following five procedural elements.A.Sample Population SelectionThe  DBIR  rank-orders  21  industries  according  to  the  number of reported data breaches, malware attacks, and other cybersecurity  incidents  [3].  From  that  list,  nine  (9)  of  the  most    frequently    breached    industries    were    selected:    Accommodation,Education,       Finance,       Healthcare,       Information,  Manufacturing,  Professional,  Public,  Retail.  Then, based on industry definitions, keywords were chosen and used in the Google and Bing search engines to discover industry-relevant  websites  that  feature  an  account  creation  process.  It  should  be  noted  for  the  Manufacturing  industry,  the existence of a process for creating an account to apply for a job was deemed acceptable, based on the assumption that the password policies used by human resources (HR) would be  consistent  with  the  password  policies  of  the  company  at  large.By  choosing  10  to  15  websites  in  each  of  these  nine categories,  data  ultimately  were  collected  from  108  sites.  Since  the  number  of  websites  on  the  internet  is  extremely  large,  this  sample  size  supported  statistical  calculations  accurate to within 10 to 12 percent of the overall population statistics with high confidence.B.Volunteer RecruitmentDue  to  time  constraints,  four  student  volunteers  wererecruited from the Computer Science Department at Norfolk State University to help with data collection..C.Script and Video CreationA  script  was  created  to  standardize  the  collection  of  experimental    observations    in    comparison    with    NIST    guidance.  To  the  maximum  extent  practicable,  the  script  focused  on  data  collectors  responding  to  a  series  of  yes/no  questions while they created a user account on each selected website,  with  just  a  few  “fill-in -the-blank”  answers.  The  resulting   script   is   shown   in   Fig.1.   In   addition,   two   instructional   videos   were   created   to   explain   the   data   collection  process  and  the  use  of  the  script  to  student  volunteers. 2023 Journal of The Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education, Volume10, No. 1, Winter2023979-8-3858-4381-7/23/$ 26.00 ©2023 CISSE3www.cisse.infoFig. 1.   Data Collection ScriptD.DataCollection and ValidationEach volunteer was provided a unique subset of websites drawn  from  the  sample,  and  instructed  to  watch  the  two  instructional  videos  before  collecting  data.  Data  collection  involved   visiting   each   site   to   create   an   account   while   following  and  answering  the  script  questions.  Sample  data  sheets   were   spot   checked   later   to   ensure   collection   procedures  had  been  followed.  Minor  inaccuracies  were  found   on   just   two   sheets,   informally   validating   the   repeatability of the data collection process and the accuracy of the volunteers’ efforts.E.Calculations and InferencesCollected  data  were  consolidated  and  summarized  to  support analysis, comparing results across industries, and to highlight  significant  trends.  These  findings  and  insights  are  discussed in the next section.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Summary</h2>
        <p>There are a number of notable observations when looking at the collected and analyzed data through the lens of NIST password  policy  compliance,  which  in  turn  suggests  many  opportunities for improvement.A.Summary of Observations•Nearly all websites (greater than 95 percent) followed the modified NIST guidance for avoiding the use of security questions and SMS-based 2FA.•The majority of websites (76 percent) have adopted NIST guidance regarding password complexity and allowed character types.•More than half of websites (61 percent) enforced minimum length in password creation.•More than half of websites (59 percent) had an account lockout policy.•Relatively few websites (19 percent) forbade the use of a naïve value like “P@ssw0rd” as an account password.While most of these statements sound positive, each one must be compared to its complement. That is, based on these findings we can expect: •Around half of all websites do not enforce minimum password length and do not have an account lockout policy.•About one in every three websites is not following NIST’s complexity or character type guidance.•Many websites (greater than 80 percent) still deem “P@ssw0rd” an acceptable password.2023 Journal of The Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education, Volume 10, No. 1, Winter 2023 979-8-3858-4381-7/23/$ 26.00 ©2023   CISSE7 www.cisse.info•A few websites still cling to security questions and SMS-based 2FA.Remedying  these  NIST  compliance  gaps  should  be  a  focus for future improvements.Sample  sizes  were  too  small  to  draw  any  statistically  significant  conclusions  about  websites’  password  policies  within  individual  industry  categories.  However,  the  per-industry observations offered earlier may suggest interesting angles for future in-vertical investigations.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This research sought to provides insights about the state of password policy creation and enforcement with respect to prevailing “best practices” from an authoritative source (i.e., NIST) across many industries’ websites internet-wide.  This  section summarizes conclusions and suggests some ways to build upon findings.A.ConclusionsThis project used the Verizon DBIR as a starting point to identify  industries  with  the  largest  number  of  cybersecurity  incidents.  Data  were  collected  from  108  randomly  selected  websites  within  nine  industries  known  to  exhibit  a  high  frequency   of   cybersecurity   incidents.   A   few   volunteer   graduate  students  “crowd  sourced”  data  collection  efforts, guided  by  instructional  videos  and  a  step-wise  script.  Eight  variables were created to represent specific aspects of NIST SP 800-63-3 guidance on credentials (passwords), along with a scorecard for assessing each site’s compliance with them. Scores  were aggregated  to  glean  statistical  insights  about  websites internet-wide. Some potential trends were remarked within  industry  verticals;  however  these  sample  sizes  were  too small to have statistical significance.Generalizing from the analysis, many websites that allow users  to  create  accounts  on  them  still  do  not  enforce  a  minimum  password  length;  nor  do  they  forbid  common,  easily  hacked  passwords;  nor  do  they  have  any  account  lockout policy. That is, these sites remain susceptible to brute force attacks. Industries with the lowest levels of compliance to  NIST  password  policies  were  Healthcare,  Retail,  and  Manufacturing.  It  was  noted,  however,  that  all  industries  scored  in  the  70  to  80  percent  range  overall,  meaning  “on  average”  they  are  complying  with  most  NIST  password  policy guidance</p>

	<h2 class="heading">Addendum:</h2>
	<h3 class="subheading">Font Choices:</h3>
	<p class="article8">In my design, I've carefully chosen fonts to create an engaging visual experience. The main font for the body text, "Lucida Sans Typewriter," offers a clean and readable look. Each article (article1 to article8) features a unique font style, such as "Broadway," "Bauhaus 93," "Wide Latin," and others. These distinct font choices add individuality to different sections.</p>
	<h3 class="subheading">Text Sizes:</h3>
	<p class="article8">While I haven't explicitly specified font sizes in the CSS, I acknowledge the importance of consistent typography. Defining specific font sizes for headings and body text can significantly enhance readability and the visual hierarchy of the document.</p>
	<h3 class="subheading">Color Choices:</h3>
	<p class="article8">My document employs a diverse color palette to enhance visual appeal. For instance, H1 headings feature the color "#17354e," while H2 headings within articles are styled with "#0077b6." These color choices provide clear distinctions between different sections. Additionally, each article boasts a unique font color, like "#7E3517," "#510a18," and more. These colors not only ensure individuality but also contribute to the dynamic visual presentation of the content.</p>
	<h3 class="subheading">Margin and Padding:</h3>
	<p class="article8">To create an aesthetically pleasing layout, I've set a 30px margin and padding for the document's body, ensuring content is well-spaced from the edges. H1 headings have a 20px margin at the top and no margin at the bottom, centering them both vertically and horizontally. The utilization of background colors, such as "background-color: #000000" for ".heading" and "background-color: #7b471d" for ".addendum-content," further enhances the structure and presentation of the document.</p>
	<h3 class="subheading">Article Sections:</h3>
	<p class="article8">I've crafted eight distinct articles, each with its unique font family and text color. These styles are intentionally chosen to ensure that each article stands out, making it easier for readers to navigate and find specific sections of interest.</p>
	<p class="article8">In summary, this "Addendum" provides an overview of my design choices in the CSS, including font selections, color palettes, margin and padding settings, and the creation of individual articles with unique styling. These design decisions collectively contribute to the document's visual appeal and readability.</p>
